    "* If you want a little extra challenge, allow users to add more movies to the data set before running the\n",

    "* You can do this by asking the user how many movies they want to add, which will allow you to use a for\n",
    "* loop and range to repeat some code a given number of times. Inside the for loop, you can write some code\n",
    "* that takes in some user input and appends a movie tuple containing the collected data to the movie list"
